all the albums live here, as posts.  MYabe tehre's a way to just loop through all the subflders and automatically generate albums?  I don't know.  Take the names of the folders as album names, some readme file becomes the flavor text for the album

I got it, load one frame at a time, a frame is the size of two screens.  Don't show elemt until entire element is loaded.  Also, sort pictures not by name but by DATE, use some build in Jekyll thing.
